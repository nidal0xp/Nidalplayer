**Learning:** Found a specific performance bottleneck in `app.js` during category/search sorting. It called `getWatchProgressForSort` for each item dynamically in the `sort()` function, leading to O(N^2) complexity because `getWatchProgressForSort` loops over the whole dictionary (`Object.values(wp)`) for each item.
**Action:** When sorting large arrays of objects, specially those that require looking up external data structures with O(N) operations, pre-calculate that data into a `Map` *before* calling `.sort()` to bring the complexity down to O(N).
